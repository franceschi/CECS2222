unitsOnHand. An  int  that holds the number of units currently in inventory.
price. A  double  that holds the item’s retail price.


Write a constructor that accepts arguments for each member variable, appropriate mutator functions that store values in these member variables, and accessor functions that return the values in these member variables.Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates three  RetailItem  objects and stores the following data in them.

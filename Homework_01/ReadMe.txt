Write a  Circle  class that has the following member variables:    
•     radius  : a  double     
•     pi  : a  double  initialized with the value 3.14159   
 The class should have the following member functions:    
•    Default Constructor.  A default constructor that sets  radius  to 0.0.    
•    Constructor.  Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument.    
•     setRadius.   A mutator function for the radius variable.    
•     getRadius.   An accessor function for the radius variable.   
•     getArea.   Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as   area = pi * radius * radius     
•     getDiameter.   Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as   diameter = radius * 2     
•     getCircumference.   Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as   circumference = 2 * pi * radius     

Write a program that demonstrates the  Circle  class by asking the user for the circle’s radius, creating a  Circle  object, and then reporting the circle’s area, diameter, and circumference.

 Programming Challenges 
 
 
 Employee  and  ProductionWorker  Classes 
 
 Design a class named  Employee . The class should keep the following information in 
 

 Employee name 
 Employee number 
 Hire date 
 
 
Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class. 
 

 Next, write a class named  ProductionWorker  that is derived from the  Employee  class. The  ProductionWorker  class should have member variables to hold the following information: 
 
 
 Shift (an integer) 
 Hourly pay rate (a  double ) 
 
 
 The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. 
 The shift variable will hold an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. 
 The day shift is shift 1, and the night shift is shift 2. 
 Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class. 
 Demonstrate the classes by writing a program that uses a  ProductionWorker  object.

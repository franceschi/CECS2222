ShiftSupervisor  Class 
 
 In a particular factory a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. 
 
 Design a  ShiftSupervisor  class that is derived from the Employee  class you created in Programming Challenge 1. The  ShiftSupervisor  class should have a member variable that holds the annual salary and a member variable that holds the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a  ShiftSupervisor  object.
